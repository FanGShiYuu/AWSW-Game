## Abstract

## Method Overview


## Experiments
Multiple experiments are conducted, including an ablation experiment on the Shapley value in a purely CAV environment, a comparison of efficiency and safety under different Rates of Penetration (ROP), and the significance test after heterogeneous HDVs involved. Here we focus on a supplementary explanation of the results of the study and present them in a more intuitive manner (especially via .MP4). For further knowledge acquisition, please refer to [arXiv]().

### Ablation experiment on the Shapley value
In order to facilitate the reader to understand how Shapley value is constantly changing in the process of cooperation, we use the shade of color to represent the value of the Shapley value. More specifically

### Comparison under different ROP

### Experiments with heterogeneous HDVs involved
