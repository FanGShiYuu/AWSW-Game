## Abstract

## Method Overview




## Experiments
Multiple experiments are conducted, including an ablation experiment on the Shapley value in a purely CAV environment, a comparison of efficiency and safety under different Rates of Penetration (ROP), and the significance test after heterogeneous HDVs involved. Here we focus on a supplementary explanation of the results of the study and present them in a more intuitive manner (especially via .MP4). For further knowledge acquisition, please refer to [arXiv]().


### Ablation experiment on the Shapley value
In order to facilitate the reader to understand how Shapley value is constantly changing in the process of cooperation, we use the shade of color to represent the value of the Shapley value. More specifically, the closer the color of the vehicle is to purple, the higher its Shapley value is at this moment. This indicates that the vehicle currently has a greater impact on the system. Conversely, lighter colors indicate weaker impacts on the system. Additionally, each car's normalized Shapley value is displayed next to it. The cooperation case shown in Fig.5 in [arXiv]() is shown below

### Comparison under different ROP
In this subsection, we compare the baseline and AWSW-PG(T=1) from an aggregate point of view at first. The results indicate that the implementation of the adaptive method provides efficient improvement for collision avoidance. A specific case comparison is shown below  


As observed in the video, collisions occur when CAVs are driven by the baseline model due to their inability to correct HDV estimates in real time. Therefore, even if all vehicles depart within a short timeframe, such situations must be avoided. However, we acknowledge that driving is a sequential decision-making process, and selecting an appropriate planning time can effectively prevent shortsighted behavior. Thus, we have extended the planning horizon to 8 steps. Additionally, we also present a case to compare the operation of the cooperation system  



### Experiments with heterogeneous HDVs involved
Considering that CAVs will continually mix with HDVs that possess various driving abilities, and styles in a long time. we further investigate our model by introducing heterogeneous human-driven vehicles into the background traffic. Specifically, we use orange, blue, and green to represent aggressive, neutral, and conservative drivers respectively (unknown information for connected autonomous vehicles). The transparency of colors indicates the discrepancy between actual actions and predicted actions. When the discrepancy between actual and predicted actions is relatively minor, HDV will be marked with a âˆš symbol.
